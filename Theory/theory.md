Within the FIREBALL program suite {cite}`lewis_2011_Fireball_AITBMD`.
slightly excited numerically generated pseudo-atomic fireball wave-functions (also known as Sankey-Niklewski wave-functions) are used.

...

In solving the one-electron Schr√∂dinger equation,

$$
  \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2m}\nabla^2 
  + V_{ext}(\mathbf{r}) 
  + \mu_{xc}[\rho_{in}(\mathbf{r})] 
  + \frac{e^2}{2}\int \frac{\rho_{in}(r)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} d^3r' \right) \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) 
  = \epsilon_i \psi_i(\mathbf{r})
$$

a set of slightly excited pseudo-atomic fireball wave-functions are computed within density-functional theory (using either the local-density approximation or generalized gradient corrections) and a norm-conserving separable pseudo-potential {cite}`sankey_1998_Approx_DFT`
